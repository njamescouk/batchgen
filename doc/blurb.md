Introduction
============

batchgen is a program to generate dos batch files from a higher level
language, making it easier to use boolean logic in batch files.

One of the failings of DOS/command.com/cmd.exe is that the only logical
operator is "not". The other big failing is that it can't add up.
batchgen is an attempt to bring boolean logic to DOS. You need to be
quite happy writing batch files before using batchgen, it doesn't quite
write them for you. If you have experience of C life will be easier.

The big idea is that we use batchgen to do all the flow of control
transformations, whilst we enclose normal DOS commands [\# rem like this
\#]. batchgen turns the flow of control statements into legal DOS
commands, and copies text enclosed in [\#\#] verbatim. 

If we have the following as input:

<pre class = "programlisting">
    if (%1==%2 && ! %3==%4 || exist %5)
        [# rem this will be copied verbatim
           @echo it's true #]

</pre>

batchgen's output is:

<pre class = "programlisting">
    @echo off
    rem this file has been generated by batchgen and may be overwritten
    rem command line: batchgen  eg1.bg
    rem date 2016-5-5 18:32:59
    
    @goto main
    :main
    if "%1" == "%2" goto AT0
    goto ORF1
    :AT0
    if "%3" == "%4" goto ORF1
    goto IF0
    :ORF1
    if exist %5 goto IF0
    goto EI0
    :IF0
     rem this will be copied verbatim
           @echo it's true 
    rem endif
    :EI0
    :batch_end

</pre>

If you ask me, that's pretty slick, and it saves a lot of unecessary
thinking.
